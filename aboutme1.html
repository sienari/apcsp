    <p>Hi, My name is Siena, I am currently a junior at Piedmont High School. I am 16 years old, I live with my mom, my dad, and my younger brother. I moved to Piedmont after 3rd grade, and I am now in 11th grade. I play soccer, and love to hangout with my friends. I am very much a people person, and I love to go outside!</p>
